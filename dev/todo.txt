- make table and column name (i.e. user vs userId) consistent

- maybe migrate mysql driver to https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql - start developing lightweight ORM

- confirm all model accessors/setters are being used: http://sequelizejs.com/docs/latest/models

- clean up models in vote_controller: http://screencast.com/t/am7str9sPjb

- post vote totals should just be part of post

- all functions with find or create should have a "retry" function

- create unique requirements on compound indexes

- confirm seeding is working correctly

- optimize removeUserFromGroup function

- add indexes
	+ confirm which should be compound
    + percentages (agreements)   
    + totals
    + user.username
    + UserVote.user  UserVote.post
    + userGroupAgreements user id group id
        - maybe total (small totals get excluded when regrouping)
    + total votes in userGroupAgreements

- find way to pass argument to require





- setup test and seed scripts

- NEED TO TEST update user group agreement

- start implementing testing

- start implementing sort script

- review and minimize sql fields - do all need created/updated?

- confirm select are only returning desired fields

- UserGroupAgreements, UserVotes don't need an id field

- ensure unique indexes are set and retrys exist for each function





- find out if it's possible to increment and DB column field and have percentage column get updated in the same query (to avoid potential overwrite situations(i.e. one user reads, second user reads, first user writes, second user overwrite first user))

- add config with DB creds

- parse urls and add http if ommited



- on delete cascade for foreign keys

- implement automated group testing

- ensure all sequelize operations use getters and setters: http://sequelizejs.com/docs/1.7.8/models


Deploy:
	- remove auto update from schema.js
	- uncomment the init flag at the top of the models.js file (this is BAD)
	- create cluster if on multi-core
	- set error handeling in app.js
	- update db creds
	- setup Redis or Mongo for session storage
	- remove novalidate from forms



UserVote not accurate up/down
